Russian Hate Speech &amp; Bias Classification: NLP pipeline with Logistic Regression &amp; Naïve Bayes

This repository contains a machine learning system for classifying biased content in Russian text. The project implements a complete NLP pipeline including text preprocessing, lemmatization with spaCy, TF-IDF vectorization, and compares Logistic Regression with Naïve Bayes classifiers for bias detection. 

Key Features: 
- Russian language text preprocessing with spaCy lemmatization
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Comparison of Logistic Regression vs. Naïve Bayes
